# 🧩 solveBox

Welcome to **solveBox** — a comprehensive collection of coding solutions aimed at conquering challenges from platforms like Codeforces, Codewars, and beyond. This repository serves as your problem-solving hub, with organized solutions to boost your algorithmic thinking and coding skills.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is structured based on platforms and challenge levels, making it easy to find solutions to specific problems.

### Example Folder Structure

- **🏆 codeforces/**  
  Contains problems from Codeforces, categorized by difficulty levels.

  - **\_A/**  
    🟢 Solutions to Codeforces problems at level A.
  - **\_B/**  
    🟡 Solutions to Codeforces problems at level B.

- **⚔️ codewars/**  
  Solutions to challenges from Codewars.

- **🔧 Additional Platforms**  
  As more platforms are included, the structure will expand accordingly.

### 🗂️ File Naming Convention

Each solution file is named according to the problem title, with the appropriate extension. Examples include:

- `codeforces/_A/watermelon.js`
- `codewars/reverse-string.py`

## 📋 Commit Message Guidelines

We follow a structured convention for commit messages to maintain clarity and consistency across the repository. The format is:

```
action(scope:level): message
```

Where:

- **action**: The type of change (e.g., `solve`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`).
- **scope**: The platform or context (e.g., `codeforces`, `codewars`).
- **level**: The problem level, if applicable (e.g., `A`, `B`).

### Examples:

- 🎯 `solve(codeforces:A): solve Watermelon problem`
- 🛠 `fix(codewars): fix bug in string reversal function`
- 🔄 `refactor(general): optimize sorting algorithm`

> **Note:** For platforms without levels, the `level` can be omitted.

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add solutions or improve existing ones:

1. 🍴 **Fork** the repository.
2. 🌿 Create a **new branch** with a descriptive name.
3. 🧠 Add your solutions, ensuring they follow the folder and commit message conventions.
4. 📝 Open a **pull request** with a clear explanation of your changes.

## 🚀 Planned Enhancements

- **📈 More Platforms**: Adding challenges from LeetCode, HackerRank, and more.
- **🔢 Expanded Problem Sets**: Continuously adding more problems, including new levels for existing platforms.
- **✅ Testing Framework**: Implementing automated tests to verify the correctness of solutions.
